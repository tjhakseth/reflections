When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are collaborating with other people.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because the changes might not make logical sense and they might cut off in the middle and thus be more confusing for understanding the changes in the code.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks copy repos from other github repos using github. clones copy repos manually. branches are deviations from the master branch with code that is not ready to be committed to master
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	If there are any breaks in the code, it would help with debugging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	through email or messenger. Much harder to read but could have more content.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	when you want collaboration or testing before as to not break the code. Just committing to the master makes things more linear and easier to follow the changes. Having branches allows more freedom to work within code and have it not negatively affect the master code.
