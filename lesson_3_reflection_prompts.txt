When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you are collaborating with other people.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because the changes might not make logical sense and they might cut off in the middle and thus be more confusing for understanding the changes in the code.
