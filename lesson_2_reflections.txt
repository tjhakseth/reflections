What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You create a respoitory in git. So you can use version control more effectively and use the git commands for debugging.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is the in between area from working directory which is composed of files and the repository which is the git storage of files. It allows you to make changes to the files without having to commit them, so you can check to make sure the code is working properly before committing it to a code change. It is a check point for a developer!
